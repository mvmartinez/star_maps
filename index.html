<h2> History of Constellations</h2>

   <p> By definition, a constellation simply means: a group of stars forming a recognizable pattern. The study of constellations has been on record since around 4000 B.C. in ancient Mesopotamia. Some time later, Eudoxus, a Greek astronomer, began to write and record constellations which still exist today.
   </p> 

<h2> Naming Constellations</h2>

  <p> Many of the constellation’s names came from Greek and Roman culture and history. Astronomers named them after the Greek and Roman gods and goddesses, animals, and other things that come from their ancient stories. However, these are not cultures and societies that constellation names originate from. Names of constellations came from all over the world, including: the Middle East, Native America, Africa, Asia, and more.

<h2>Constellations Today</h2>

  <p> Today, a total of 88 recognized constellations exist in the universe. The recognized constellations and their drawn boundaries were created by the International Astronomical Union, which was formed in 1919. Since then, astronomers and anyone looking up at the night sky alike, have been finding and identifying the different constellations. Constellations are known to move with the changing seasons. Depending on what season that someone is in they will see different constellations when they look at the sky.

<h2>Astrology & Zodiac Signs</h2>

 <p> Over time, the study of astrology has become quite popular in modern society. Astrology is the study of the star movements and how they influence human lives. It is commonly thought that a person’s astrological sign will indicate or affect their personality, luck, how they interact with others, and more. An individual’s astrological sign is determined by the zodiac and under which constellation they were born within. The zodiac is a sun belt which contains 12 separate constellations, each corresponding with certain months and days of the year.
